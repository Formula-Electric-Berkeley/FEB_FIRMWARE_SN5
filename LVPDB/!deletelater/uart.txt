In a seperate clone, I added a Uart transmission function that can grab the voltage 
and display it in the serial monitor, however I haven't transferred it to the main core subdirectory  
yet since I think it is best if I finish the migration to I2C readings first, and by "unhardcoding" adresses. 

But if you were curious on the code, I have copy and pasted it from my other files: 

/* 
	UART Quality of Life Features
	
	static void uartPrinting(void) { 
	char buffer[64]; 
	while (1) { 
		float read = lv_voltage; 
		int bytes = snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "Current Voltage: %.2f V\r\n", read);
		HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart2, (uint_t*)buffer, bytes, HAL_MAX_DELAY); 
		HAL_Delay(1000); 
		}
	}
